        <h1>Here are the basics of programming</h1>
        

        <h2>Variables</h2>

<script>
    // This is a single line comment in JavaScript
    /* This is a multiline comment in JavaScript */ 

    // let's create our first variable
    var firstName = "Skye";

    // create the variable, set it to an empty string;
    // we will give it a value later
    var lastName = "";

    // the 3rd way to create a variable - this is a valid way of creating a variable in JavaScript
    // DO NOT USE THIS METHOD
    middleName = "D";

</script>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<script>
    //this is a JavaScript function definition; we need to use the keyword function
    //functions are awesome - you write code 1 time and can reuse it throughout your program
    //functions help organize code
    //function names should usually be some sort of action
    //always include the () - sometimes there will be variables(s) in between the () or they may be empty 
    //always make sure there are a matching set of curly braces {}
    function runCalc(){ // do not mix ; and {}
        //whatever code is in between the curly braces belongs to this function
        //we will create a variable called num1, and we are going to give it a default value of 0
        //JavaScript should assume this is a numeric datatype
        var num1 = 0;
        var num2 = 0;

        // we want to prompt the user for a number, using the built in JavaScript prompt function
        // the prompt function takes an argument (variable) - the text that will be shown to the user with the prompt
        // the prompt function returns the value that the user entered in
        // set num1 variable equal to the value the user entered in
        num1 = prompt("Please enter number 1: "); // most lines of JavaScript need a ; at the end

        // get another number from the user and assign it to the num2 variable
        num2 = prompt("Please enter number 2: "); // most lines of JavaScript need a ; at the end

        // let's add num1 and num2 together and store that value in the total variable
        // the built in JavaScript function parseInt makes sure that JavaScript treats the num1 and num2 variables as integers (whole numbers)
        var total = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);

        // call the built in Javascript function called alert - this will show a message to the user
        // it should show our numbers and the total
        alert("The total of " + num1 + " plus " + num2 + " is " +total);

    }

    // we have created the function, now we need to call it so that the function code will run
    // the () are blank because we don't need to pass any information into this function
    runCalc();

    // the code here does not belong to the function
</script>
